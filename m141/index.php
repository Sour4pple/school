							<h3>Yamaha FZ8n</h3>
							<p>Only a fool challenges the FZ8. Because the R-series derived high-performance engine is built to outrun anything in the class. And the sophisticated Deltabox chassis and high-specification braking system give this mean and moody fighter the egde over the rest.</p>
